You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /mnt/04D7170C2EC1C67B/node and express mongodb/Genius-Car-Mechanics-module-61

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are currently outside your home directory
  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
